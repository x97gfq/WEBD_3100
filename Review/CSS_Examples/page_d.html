		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		
		<p class="sidebar">"It looks like a rich mosaic of 3,500 students from more than 50 countries. A beautiful green oasis of gardens, walking trails and ivy-covered buildings. Athletics facilities where everyone works and trains to be a little bit better than before. Friendly faces—peers and professionals—there to lend a hand when things don't feel right. We want to make sure your university experience is a safe and healthy one." www.acadiau.ca (Student Life)</p>
