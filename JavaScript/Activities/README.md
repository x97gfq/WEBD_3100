# WEBD 1000 — Live Code‑Along Activities (Node.js)

This folder contains **classroom code‑along** activities for beginners. Each script is small,
self‑contained, and uses Node’s built‑in `readline` for user input. Every file ends with a
**Starter Exercises** block so students can extend the demo immediately.

## How to run
1. Install Node.js (LTS is fine).
2. Open a terminal in this folder.
3. Run any activity, e.g.:
   ```bash
   node magic8.js
   ```

## Files & Learning Goals
- **`magic8.js` — Magic‑8 Ball**
  - *Concepts:* arrays, random selection, functions, readline loop, simple validation.
- **`dice.js` — Dice Roller (NdM)**
  - *Concepts:* parsing strings ("2d6"), random integers, loops, array reduce, validation.
- **`guessing.js` — Number Guessing (High/Low)**
  - *Concepts:* while‑style prompting, number parsing, comparison, attempt counting.
- **`rps.js` — Rock–Paper–Scissors**
  - *Concepts:* normalization of input, conditional logic/switch, simple game loop.
- **`convert.js` — Temperature Converter (C ↔ F)**
  - *Concepts:* functions with returns, parsing, rounding, validation.
- **`quiz.js` — Tiny Quiz (3–5 questions)**
  - *Concepts:* arrays of objects, loops, scoring, case‑insensitive comparison.

## Teaching flow (suggested)
1. Magic‑8 Ball (10–12 min)
2. Dice Roller (10–12 min)
3. Number Guessing (15–20 min)
4. Rock–Paper–Scissors or Converter (10–12 min)
5. Quiz (time permitting)

> Tip: Ask students to **predict the output** before running each script, then compare.
